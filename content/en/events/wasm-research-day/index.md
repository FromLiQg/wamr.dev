Wasm Research Day brings together researchers from academia and industry, as well as participants in the CG standards body, to discuss research and long-term topics related to WebAssembly. Co-located with the October 26-27 hybrid [Wasm Community Group Meeting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/main/main/2022/CG-10.md), it allows a unique opportunity for participants to discuss ongoing standardization work as well as strategic directions for WebAssembly.
